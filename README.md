## :memo: Work flow

### Step 1: Sharing Ideas & Creating the Repository

:rocket: 

### Step 2: Create Server

First we installed the ***dependencies and devDependencies*** taht we need to our project then we **Created NodeJs Express server** 


### Step 3: Creat Database

we realized we need to connect between the tables of the database so we made a primary key for each one of them :

| Table               | PK                      |
| -----------------   |:----------------------- |
| patients            | Id                      |
| doctors             | Id                     |
| reviews             | Id                      |

how we made it?

- [ ] Draw the Database Schema .
- [ ] Connect the database with the Express Server using 'PG' module.
- [ ] Creat the build.js file to build the database.
